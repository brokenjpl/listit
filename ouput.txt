This is a very big deal so it takes top priority. I go to his files to see that all of his files are ending in .MICRO for the file extensions, so say a spreadsheet was spreadsheet.xls.MICRO now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know much about why it happened, so simply renaming the file to remove the added extension showed a garbled mess. This is when I realized that the files are being encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I checked out his PC, and it&amp;#39;s entirely clean, not even the simplest issue with his PC for what I can find. As I&amp;#39;m checking this PC, more people are reporting the issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I send out an immediate email saying that they need to save any files locally as I&amp;#39;m pulling the plug on the server to start checking things out, and with a huge outcry from users, I assure them this is a last resort option. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The server, like the president&amp;#39;s computer, was absolutely clean, but tons of the files were encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We take a look at the timestamp for when the first file became encrypted and started getting the DHCP timestamps for who got a new IP at this time in case it was a rogue computer that was connected to our network that was causing the issues, and it just so happened that we had a list of 40 or so PCs that grabbed a new IP during a 5 minute period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My supervisor and I start checking every last PC on the list, and a lot of them showed no issue, and a handful of them showed encrypted files. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start checking for malware, and happened to miss the one that had the malware on it, so we start disconnecting all PCs on the list to stop the bleeding and start copying my backup to the drives effected by the encryption. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spend about 14 hours after this point (after already working roughly 6 hours that day) getting things back to normal, and notice that another drive was being encrypted on top of the ones we had fixed, and it&amp;#39;s a department drive. We see who all has access to both drives and then start checking PCs the next day with our server pulled back off the network, and low and behold, Bob is on the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bob comes to my desk first thing in the morning, complaining that his &amp;quot;piece of junk&amp;quot; computer ($1,300 Thinkpad from 2015) doesn&amp;#39;t boot anymore. We also noticed that whatever PC was doing the encryption has stopped. &lt;strong&gt;RED FLAG&lt;/strong&gt; Mind you, this user tried blaming me for his PC issues after working on his PC, as if I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to start his laptop up, and the thing won&amp;#39;t even act like it&amp;#39;s loading windows. Just splash screen, black screen, splash screen, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take out his HDD and toss it onto a dock, and I immediately get a call from my HQ saying that my protection software is lighting up like a Christmas tree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is our guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s complaining about not having the ability to do his work, and I&amp;#39;m working with HQ to get things back online. Before I reimage the machine though, they wanted a full log of all the bad things from his HDD scan, and it was quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, his PC was so bad that it encrypted everything but the OS, and something else came in and destroyed the boot loader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are now finally back to &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; with tons of permissions redone (properly this time) and backing up everything again like a madman. We are going to be discussing his fate with my supervisor, manager, him, and his manager today. Also, his laptop feels like the back was sanded with a high grit sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, given everything through the time I&amp;#39;ve been here, I wanted it to not be him. I was hoping for the one redeeming factor of believing it was him and seeing someone else fall, but it had to be Bob. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL:DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;User who is &amp;quot;bad with computers&amp;quot; encrypts nearly my entire server, taking most of our company offline for the entire duration it took from pulling the plug to getting the server back online where users can work.

He had his hand on my back and then he kept moving it downwards to my ass and inside my underwear. I had told him an hour ago privately to not put his hand inside my underwear. whilst talking to my friends, I kept moving his hand upwards, and firmly placing it on my back to show him I&amp;#39;m not uncomfortable.

At this point he can tell I&amp;#39;m extremely uncomfortable, I&amp;#39;m not looking him in the eye, I&amp;#39;m not saying much, I&amp;#39;m not doing anything (normally when we do stuff, I&amp;#39;m quite vocal and confident and initiate things on my part). He tells me he&amp;#39;s sorry about touching me down there before because he &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; I told him not to, even though I kept moving his hand. I told him I didn&amp;#39;t want to kiss him because I was too scared a teacher will catch us. So he said that&amp;#39;s okay and started touching me between my legs again and said &amp;quot;atleast I can do this under the desk&amp;quot;. At this point, I thought to myself, I&amp;#39;m just going to get him off so it&amp;#39;s over and done with. So I stroked him over his trousers till he came.

He has been texting me but I don&amp;#39;t want to read the messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel embarrassed and humiliated and just disgusted that this happened in a classroom.

I have always been too much of a people&amp;#39;s pleaser and I don&amp;#39;t like disappointing others hence why I don&amp;#39;t like using the safe word.
